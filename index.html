           Sophie Foster is ready to fight back.
Her talents are getting stronger, and with the elusive Black Swan group ignoring her calls for help, she’s determined to find her kidnappers—before they come after her again.
But a daring mistake leaves her world teetering on the edge of war and causes many to fear that she has finally gone too far. And the deeper Sophie searches, the farther the conspiracy stretches, proving that her most dangerous enemy might be closer than she realizes.

In this nail-biting third book in the Keeper of the Lost Cities series, Sophie must fight the flames of rebellion, before they destroy everyone and everything she loves.
       </div>
       <div class="Kotlc">
            Everglen, they see Alden talking to Councillor Kenric. Since Sophie is slightly uncomfortable revealing this news in front of a Councillor, Kenric leaves. Sophie tells Alden and goes to talk to Biana and ask her what her "surprise" is. When she walks into the room, she spots Fitz seemingly talking by himself. But then, Biana appears and tells Sophie she had manifested as a Vanisher.
On the first day of school, Sophie gets her schedule while Biana and Dex are in for a surprise. There is an announcement saying that Biana has manifested as a Vanisher, but also one saying that Dex has manifested as a Technopath. Angry that someone has revealed his secret, Dex is in a bad mood for the rest of the day. Sophie sees that she is still taking telepathy sessions with Fitz and is delighted.

day goes by and Sophie discovers that there are plans for her to heal Fintan. She is shocked, but she can do little against it. Tiergan tells her that he, Alden, Quinlin, and Fitz are available to aid her during the healing. After some contemplation, she chooses Fitz. They tell each other three secrets, at Tiergan's recommendation, and Fitz is able to read Sophie's mind. Shocked and scared, she blocks him. They try to recreate it with five secrets, but it goes poorly. Meanwhile, Stina is shouting harsh remarks at Sophie and Fitz for the healing, as usual. Marella soon joins in, potentially jealous of Biana manifesting. Dex, also potentially jealous about Fitz and Sophie's cooperation, attempts to create an ability-enhancing device, although it does not go well.

After a terrible session with Lady Cadence, aromark is found to be on Silveny's tracker. Everyone that handled the tracker has the top layer of their hand skin melted off, but Keefe has to be purged twice because (unbeknownst to him) there is aromark on his family pin. When Sophie goes home, she finds Biana and Edaline there, and Biana is trying on Jolie's things. Afterward, Biana manages to convince Sophie to let her help with "whatever she's working on."</div>

<div class="Kotlc">Before the healing, Grady tells Sophie that Fintan may know who set the fire that killed Jolie and is the unregistered Pyrokinetic. When the time for the healing comes, it goes poorly. Although they all wear fire-resistant clothing of Flareadon and Bennu feathers, Fintan gains consciousness and sets the Everblaze on everyone present. Flareadons and apparently Bennu cannot resist Everblaze. This includes Sophie, Fitz, Alden, Bronte, Oralie, and Kenric. Sophie, Fitz, and Oralie along with Alden and Bronte make it out in time, but Kenric is killed in the fire (Fintan is believed to have also been killed, but it its later revealed in the series that he was not.) Still, Sophie almost sees who the missing Pyrokinetic is. She and Fitz go and collect Quintessence from the Unmapped Star Elementine to help make Frissyn that stops the Everblaze. Much of the city of Eternalia is destroyed.

At Kenric's planting, the king of the Ogres, King Dimitar, arrives. Sophie attempts to go into his mind to find out who put the tracker on Silveny. After she makes it deep inside, he detects her. It is a violation of the Elf-Ogre treaty and Sophie has to be punished. She goes home and continues working to find out who the unregistered pyrokinetic is.</div>

<div class="Kotlc"> Council decides her punishment along with the newest councillor, Dame Alina. Sophie's punishment is an ability-restricting device. Dex created it by fixing his ability enhancing device, but Sophie isn't incredibly angry at him, though she's very frustrated with the constant headaches it gives her. He offers to take it off, even if it means him being exiled, but Sophie refuses. When she gets home, she is a wreck. She willingly takes slumberberry tea, a sedative, and refuses to leave her room. Keefe, Biana, and Fitz coax her out. Sophie continues searching for the unregistered pyrokinetic when she finally finds him. It is Brant.

Sophie tells Grady and he gets extremely angry. He goes to visit Brant, but Sophie grabs onto him and follows. There, Brant and Grady fight. When all is about to be lost, Dex appears and punches Brant with a special gadget he invented that increases the strength of the punch. Before Sophie lets Brant go. Brant tells her that he knows about the ambush at Mount Everest. Dex takes the ability restrictor off Sophie's head and throws it into the Everblaze. Sophie teleports to Mount Everest where her friends are currently defending the Black Swan from the rebels, called the Neverseen.

Mr. Forkle who saves her before she dies of cold and lack of oxygen. Then, he shows Fitz how to get past Sophie's blocking. Fitz, Keefe, Biana, and Sophie fight the Neverseen. Keefe finds out that it is not his dad, but rather his mom pretending to be his dad, in the Neverseen. But before Lady Gisela, Keefe’s mom, can blast her son with a melder, Biana tackles her down a hill. The fight continues and eventually, they make it out alive. Sandor is badly injured but is healed later on.

All five of them meet in Everglen at night. The parents agree that it is in their best interest to join the Black Swan now. Fitz relays that he found out their next location is in Florence, Italy. The story ends with Sophie saying, "Let's go join the Black Swan!"</div>

      <div class="Kotlc">
          Sophie Foster doesn’t know what–or whom–to believe. And in a game with this many players, the worst mistake can be focusing on the wrong threat.

But when the Neverseen prove that Sophie is far more vulnerable than she ever imagined, she realizes it's time to change the rules. Her powerful abilities can only protect her so much. To face down her ruthless enemies, she must learn to fight.

Unfortunately, battle training can’t help a beloved friend who's facing a whole different danger—where the only solution involves one of the biggest risks Sophie and her friends have ever taken. And the distraction might be exactly what the villains have been waiting for.

In this unforgettable seventh book in the New York Times and USA TODAY bestselling Keeper of the Lost Cities series, Sophie must let the past and present blur together, because the deadliest secrets are always the ones that get erased.

      <div class="Kotlc">
          Many Vackers gathered to hear the Council decide what to do with Alvar, who had lost his memory. Sophie, Keefe, the Councillors, and bodyguards were the only non-Vackers present. The Council decided that they could not currently sentence Alvar due to his memory loss, and decided he was to spend six months at Everglen carefully observed. Fallon Vacker shows up, and protests Alvar's future residence at Everglen because of the possibility of something secret hidden there. Luzia Vacker, the mother of the famous Orem Vacker and founder of Everglen, discards these claims, stating that she only chose Everglen to relax after a long day of bending sunlight. However, Sophie, Keefe, and Fitz all think she is hiding something.

The Training Area and an Encounter With the Neverseen
Sophie finds Fitz at a makeshift training area they had set up in the middle of nowhere. After a while of talking and training with Grizel, members of the Neverseen (Gethen, Umber and Ruy) show up. Umber tortures Sophie, Fitz, and their bodyguards using shadowflux, which we later learn was to motivate Tam to learn how to control it as well. This causes severe injuries to both Sophie and Fitz. Sophie presses her panic switch, and eventually, Dex, Wylie, and Lovise arrive to save them, getting minor injuries in the process. During this meeting, the Neverseen reveals that the caches Keefe got during his exploit in their base are fake.The Recovery and Echoes/ The Great Fitzphie Slumber Party
Sophie and Fitz have shadow imprints from their attack by Umber, called echoes. Sophie has one near her head, Fitz near his heart. These lead Sophie to experience terrible nightmares based on her fears and traumas over the years, slowing her recovery, while Fitz has to manage his emotions, or else his breathing becomes constricted and his heart feels like something's crushing it. At first, Elwin attempted to fix it by inducing The Great Fitzphie Ooze Fest, but it doesn't work. Recovery time is spent resting from all their injuries, training in Exillium skills with Keefe and learning how to deal with their echoes.
</div>
<div class="Kotlc">
After several weeks of recovery, Elwin allows Sophie and Fitz to leave the Healing Center—though not Foxfire. While they wander the halls at night, they find out that Tam has been training with Lady Zillah, to learn how to control shadowflux, every night, with Linh to keep him company. After more recovery, only Fitz is allowed to go home, since his echo was not as severe as Sophie's. At first, he wants to stay until she is released as well, but after Biana comes to visit, Sophie convinces him to go home and be there for his sister when Alvar comes to stay. She stays in contact with him, and learn about the deal he struck with his parents regarding his older brother.Once Sophie gets back to Havenfield, Sandor greets her with four new bodyguards: Bo the ogre (who we later learn is married to Ro), Flori the gnome, Nubiti the dwarf and Tarina the troll. After everyone is introduced, Tarina starts a conversation with Sophie in her native tongue, asking for an alliance with the Moonlark on her queen's behalf. Sophie says she'll think about it. Sandor then sets up a training session for her, teaching her how to hold and throw a dagger with a dummy that Sandor painted with Gethen's eyes. He rigs the dummy with Lushberry Juice as blood to show her the horrors of battle, and Sophie freaks out, showing herself how unprepared she was.
</div>
<div class="Kotlc">
When Sophie and Fitz both get wounded by shadowflux, they were stuck together in the Healing Center with Elwin. They grew closer throughout this time and at one point Fitz even hand-fed Sophie because she couldn't open the elixirs due to her arm. They even walked around alone through Foxfire one night. Throughout the book, their relationship grows closer, especially when Fitz tells her that she is the only one he wants on his matchmaking list while at Everglen. Sophie then admits her crush. They almost kiss before Silveny invades Sophie's head to tell her she is in labor and the baby is coming. Sophie often leans on Fitz's shoulder throughout the book, saying it is her favorite place. They have moments like this throughout the book. One point, before they meet with Fintan, Fitz comes to Havenfield and gives Sophie a teal heart-shaped locket.After a visit to Fintan, Fitz and Sophie learn that the Neverseen are planning something for the Celestial Festival. The Black Swan makes a plan to use illusions to capture any Neverseen members: holograms of the keeper crew will be milling around the crowd, while the real crew walks along the perimeter of the festival, searching for members of the Neverseen. They come up with nothing, but Alvar's tracker says he is moving around Everglen. Fitz becomes suspicious and tries to shock him—however, Sophie's fake pin that she got from Tinker disrupts the gadget, and it doesn't work. Everyone then leaps to Everglen to stop Alvar.
</div>
<div class="Kotlc">
They find Alvar at the gates, and Fitz tackles him to the ground and beats him. The Neverseen show up, including Cad, Ro's ex-boyfriend, and try and coax Fitz into murdering his older brother; if not for Sophie's words, he might have. But when he fails, the Neverseen disappear, revealing the images in front of the crew were just illusions. Sophie and her friends then follow them into the woods of Everglen, where they watch Alvar turn on the override and they discover the hidden Troll Hive.Three of the baby trolls escape. One takes down one of Cad's guards, and the other two go after Sophie and her friends. They eventually defeat the baby trolls using their own teeth against them. In the fight, Umber gets crushed by the door of the hive and killed. Her skull is so crushed that it's impossible to determine her identity. Alvar is trapped in one of the birthing pods, but survives and later escapes using temperature regulation and breathing control skills, which Keefe says he excels at.
</div>
<div class="Kotlc">
Soon after the battle of the hive, Silveny transmits to Sophie, saying there's danger and asking for Keefe and Tam. Sophie immediately teleports with Keefe and Tam to where the baby alicorns are being kept and finds Lady Gisela standing between Silveny and Greyfell. Lady Gisela says they need a Shade, due to Umber's death, and turns her attention to Tam. He asks Lady Gisela, sarcastically, if they plan on kidnapping him. Keefe's mom replies that they learned kidnapping doesn't work through Sophie's kidnapping and proceeds to shoot Silveny and Greyfell with a new version of soporidine. She then holds up the antidote and tells Tam the only way to get it and save the alicorn is to join them. When he still hesitates, she threatens the baby alicorns as well, causing an outburst from Keefe. Finally, Lady Gisela tells Tam that she has ways to hurt Linh, saying if he refused, "chaos would rain down on her within the hour." Tam finally agrees, despite Sophie's desperate assurances that they can protect Linh (which weren't very secure, since their last assured safety wasn't very safe) and Keefe's warnings that he's making a big mistake, with Tam replying, "Well, I'm not you." Tam hands Sophie the antidote, and Lady Gisela warns him that he will not have the same privileges Keefe did, and, until he proves himself, he is expendable. Before Sophie and Keefe can react, she knocks Tam out and leaps away with him. Sophie panics and wants to go rescue him.
</div>
<div class="Kotlc">
Linh is the one that says they shouldn't rescue him, saying that her brother could take care of himself.At the end of the book, Sophie asks her parents to register for the match. Grady immediately goes into protective father mode. Edaline, however, is ecstatic and helps Sophie get ready. They go to Atlantis with Sophie dressed in her best gown. When they arrive at the matchmaking building, Sophie takes a deep breath before walking in. Her registry feed alerts them she is there, so she waits in the waiting room as people whisper around her about the fact that Sophie Foster is registering for the match. She is pulled into a room alone with two workers whose movements are the exact same. They ask her some questions, including who her birth parents are. Sophie cannot answer this because she was never told. After a few minutes of awkward and anxious waiting, it comes back that Sophie Elizabeth Foster is UNMATCHABLE. It is presumed she is unmatchable because she does not know who her genetic parents are.
